            I began a Photography class at UWF this semester and wanted to update my portfolio. These photographs show my different views on different things as well as how I go about editing the photographs. The link below will take you to my Flickr account full of my photographs. Have fun and don't be shy to comment on any of them. I absolutely love feedback of any kind!
